Final Project for CS32 

Computational Subtask for Project: Track and store locational data, use to create statistics

I will be tracking the locations of multiple users over time and using these locations to find the most popular locations.

Parts of this task:
  - how to access the locations of different users
  - storing the locations of these users
  - calculating statistics of these user locations (mode?)

Update: 04/10/22

    Goals:
  
        1.) convert ip addresses of multiple users into a data structure that maps 
        ip addresses to latitude and longitude coordinates (and maybe street addresses, too?)
  
        2.) find mean or mode of latitude/longitude coordinates to find most popular locations
  
        3.) convert most popular coordinate locations to most popular street addresses

    Timeline:
    
        By 04/17/22- write code to calculate the most popular locations from latitude/longitude
        coordinates (data processing)
        
        By 04/24/22- write code to take ip addresses from multiple users at once, convert to 
        latitude and longitude coordinates, and collate into data structure
        
        By 05/01/22- write code to convert output popular coordinate locations to most popular street addresses
          - connect all of the code
