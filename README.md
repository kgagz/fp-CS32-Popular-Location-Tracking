Final Project for CS32 

Computational Subtask for Project: Track and store locational data, use to create statistics

I will be tracking the locations of multiple users over time and using these locations to find the most popular locations.

Parts of this task:
  - how to access the locations of different users
  - storing the locations of these users
  - calculating statistics of these user locations (mode?)
